OS -> Assignment 02 [File Systems and directories]

Making directories proved to be a challenge to me as i had to find a way to make them in disc and save them there.  

Truncate functionality was also hard to implement as it was updating the blocks.

I also implemented the save funcionality so it automatically saves my data and prevents my previously written files from deleting just becaue i exited my system.
